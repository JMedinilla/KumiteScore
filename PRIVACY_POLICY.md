## Kumite Score: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Kumite Score app for Android.

This is an open source Android app developed by Javier Medinilla. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy seriously enough to understand the problems that can arise from personal data being collected or sold without direct knowledge to the end user.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identificable information. Apart from that, any other data related to the application preferences are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Permissions

Not a single permission is required by this app, as it can be seen in the Manifest file of the repository:

[https://github.com/JMedinilla/KumiteScore/blob/main/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/JMedinilla/KumiteScore/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Javier Medinilla.
